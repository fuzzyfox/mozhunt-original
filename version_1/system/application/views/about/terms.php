			<h1>MozHunt Terms of Use</h1>
			<p>These terms are subject to change.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					MozHunt has the right to store the following information for the purpose of running mozhunt fairly and efficiently.
					<ul>
						<li>Name</li>
						<li>Email</li>
						<li>Websites that the user has found tokens on (tokens currently known as pandas).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The 5 users who have the most tokens at any one time will be displayed on a public page using their registered username.</li>
				<li>MozHunt will keep user details for future contact regarding new hunts that are to be run.</li>
				<li>If MozHunt deems a user to be cheating or breaking <?=anchor('about/rules', 'the rules')?> they will have their total reset to 0 tokens.</li>
				<li>MozHunt was created by Brinkhurst Design and as such is in no way partnered with, nor connected with, Mozilla in any way. All work by Brinkhurst 
				Design that mentions Mozilla or any Mozilla products (such as Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Fennec, etc...) is all done as volunteer work as a part of the 
				Mozilla Community, and so users will respect this and not promote MozHunt as a Mozilla project.</li>
